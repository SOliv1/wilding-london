    <h4 class="header--sub-header">We believe in doing something to help wildlife in our own streets, with our own hands. We have lots of ideas and initiatives we want to share with schools, businesses and the community at large.  One idea we love, is seeing sad and dull places, no matter how small, become vibrant with colour and life. We also hope to learn more about what makes a good home for nature, and other ways we can help. Our passion is to create a more nature-friendly neighbourhood, and add colour and beauty for people to enjoy. A bonus with wildflowers is that it’s not a problem if their seeds spread, and they don’t need a lot of maintenance. We are keen for others to join in and come up with ideas too; we want to share!</h4>
