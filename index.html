We have lots of ideas and initiatives we want to share with schools, businesses and the community at large.  One idea we love, is seeing sad and dull places, no matter how small, become vibrant with colour and life. We also hope to learn more about what makes a good home for nature, and other ways we can help. Our passion is to create a more nature-friendly neighbourhood, and add colour and beauty for people to enjoy. A bonus with wildflowers is that it’s not a problem if their seeds spread, and they don’t need a lot of maintenance. We are keen for others to join in and come up with ideas too; we want to share!</h4>

                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">FUTURE PLANS FOR NATURE (Winter-Spring 2022 /23).</h4>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">A National Conversation took place last year from 30th September until 30th October, where members of the public from across the UK contributed nearly 30,000 responses to an open call for ideas and stories. The first phase opened with the following questions:</h5>
                
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">
			<ol>
				<li>What do you love about nature?</li>
              			<li>What exciting examples have you seen of people working together to restore and protect nature in the UK?</li>
              			<li>What would you miss if it disappeared?</li>
              			<li>Imagine it’s 2050 and nature in the UK is thriving. What is different from now?</li> 
				
			</ol>
		</h5>
		<h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">The second phase brought together The People’s Assembly for Nature where a cross section of people took part, reflecting on the future of nature and the changes needed. Topics discussed included the food industry; farming; nature conservation; health; community engagement, and so on. From this Assembly, members implemented Calls for Action crafted for national and local governments, charities, businesses, communities and individuals. Vision Statements for the future of nature in the UK were also produced. The plan is part of an ambitious programme to build on the Save Our Wild Isles Project. The UK is home to some of the most amazing species – from puffins to orcas, beavers and butterflies. Human actions are driving nature to the brink</h5>
		<h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">The UK is now one of the most nature depleted countries globally. Three of the UK’s leading conservation charities – the RSPB, WWF, and the National Trust – are working with communities to co-create a People’s Plan for Nature to protect and renew UK nature</h5>
		<h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">Nature is in crisis and requires bold new thinking to tackle this huge challenge. The People’s Plan created a “RAPID Democracy” process, developed and inspired by the RAPID framework for corporate decision-making. </h5>
		<h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">The five phases of the process are: Input, Recommend, Decide, Agree and Perform</h5>
		<h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">Those who took part agreed the overall experience was a positive one and their views were valued. The Assembly genuinely accounted for diversity of perspectives and experiences; its recommendations truly reflecting the breadth of views in the UK today.</h5>

                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">To Rake or Not To Rake(Autumn 2022).</h4>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">The experts have spoken saying that it is good for the planet to let the leaves lie where they fall.  It is said that compost at the base of a tree or a shrub, right above its root zone where they return nutrients that the plant can then recycle and reuse next spring. </h5>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">Eindhoven council in the Netherlands, says ‘Allowing autumn leaves in parks and gardens to decompose boosts insect and soil health’.  They are encouraging their citizens to abandon the blowers and the rakes</h4> 
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">Here are some of the pros and cons of raking autumn leaves:</h5>
                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">PROS:</h4>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">A lawn needs sunlight even in the fall to store energy in its roots. A few scattered leaves on the lawn won't harm it. 

                    Rake leaves, compost them in a home compost pile or drop them off at a municipal "rake and take" program, offering leaves to people who want them for their own compost piles. 
                    
                    Use them as mulch around perennials over the winter or till them into vegetable garden soil, assuming the leaves are not carrying any diseases. 
                    
                    Leaves provide a home to bugs, from earthworms to salamanders and hedgehogs. There's an entire ecosystem living in there! The bugs living in these leaves are also a vital food source for birds.
                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #dacfcf;">CONS:</h4>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">Heavy layers of leaves left over winter, prevent sunlight from reaching grass, which can inhibit healthy growth, becoming wet and compacted, further damaging the lawn and creating a messy appearance. 

                    Raking them up in the fall, though, can reduce the diseases you encounter the following spring and summer. 
                    
                    Fallen leaves often harbor disease, which can overwinter when the leaves are left on the ground. 
                    
                    Raking leaves can create environmental issues.  If leaves are removed from the garden and raked into the street, for example.  The leaves may find their way into the gutters and into the streams and rivers where they release nitrogen and phosphorus encouraging algae growth. Excessive algae growth depletes the water of oxygen and kills fish and other aquatic life. 
                    My own take is that if you have a large garden, leave the beautiful carpets of leaves for as long as possible; (you do not have to remove them all) when it finally looks untidy, and you cannot tolerate the site of them anymore, by Jove then Rake!</h5>

                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">Meadows and White-Clover are Good for Water Shortages (Summer 2022).</h4>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">During such times when water is scarce, meadows are a good alternative to lawns. Meadows being more drought tolerant than traditional lawns, comprise of many deep rooted plants that remain green, whereas grasses may go brown. "Non grass lawns" such as white-clover, self-heal and creeping Jenny are more robust as they require no water. Good to know.</h5>

                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">The re-introduction of Bisons in the UK after an absence of a few thousand years is a welcome respite and good news in an age of mass extinction, much of it due to human intervention (Summer 2022).</h4> 
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">The project is part of a wider pioneering scheme to reintroduce large herbivores to one of south-east England’s largest areas of ancient woodland. You can read more about it in the report here at <a class="link-secondary" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/595ca91bebbd1a1d0aaab285/t/5a31691724a6943ad2478979/1513187611702/ENRR+648+naturalistic+grazing+9+June+05_1.pdf"><span id="bold">'English Nature'</span></a>. Affectionately known as woolly bulldozers, they were reintroduced during summer 2022 to help regenerate the landscape. As quoted in the report 'This shifting mosaic of open grassland, scrub and
                    closed tree-cover was created and maintained by large herbivores, particularly aurochs (wild
                    ox), ponies and bison. As a consequence shade-intolerant species such as oak Quercus spp
                    and hazel Corylus avellana were able to survive competition from species such as beech
                    Fagus sylvatica. This landscape, and the grazing processes that shaped it, provide the origin
                    of much of the flora and fauna that we seek to conserve'. Now that is a project worth following.</h5>

                <h4 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">De-Extinction (August 2022)</h4>
                <h5 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px #9f6666;">An interesting article featured in The Saturday Telegraph Magazine focuses on <a class="link-secondary" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/de-extinction"><span id="bold">'de-extinction'</span></a> , a growing movement of activists and scientists trying to revive lost species via genetic engineering. The aim is to 're-stabilise' the Eco-systems of the Earth by the restoration of key species whose ecological role has not been replaced. By so doing, they hope to inspire a new generation of conservationists into developing advanced technologies and thus help preserve existing species facing climate change.

The colours of blue, purple and red merging into gold, orange and yellow are vibrant and fill the air with lovely scent and joyous uplifting vibes in the heart of London especially on a sunny day.  The birds are happy, the wildlife is buzzing with joy and life is wonderful!</h5><h5 style="text-shadow: 3px 3px #392219;">The project was a feat of ingenuity performed by the team of Royal Historic Palaces. They imported tons of special soil and planted millions of seeds from different seed mixes into sections, all sown by hand. It looks blooming marvellous and fit for a Queen!</h5>
